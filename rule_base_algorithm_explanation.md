### Algorithm: Rule Base Data Cleaning & Flagging in Database

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `CorrectionEdits = ∅`: This is an empty set where we will store all the tuples that have been corrected.
   - `FlaggingEdits = ∅`: This is another empty set for storing tuples that could not be corrected and hence were flagged as erroneous.
   - `S = infer_issues(t, Q, D)`: This step initializes a set `S` which contains all the tuples suspected to be erroneous. This set is derived based on the input query `Q`, the tuple `t`, and the database `D`.

2. **Main Loop (while S ≠ ∅ do):**
   - This loop will continue as long as there are tuples in set `S` that need to be processed.

3. **Processing Each Tuple (foreach tuple `r` in `S` do):**
   - For each tuple `r` in the set `S`, the algorithm applies the data cleaning rules (like correcting date formats, capitalizing strings, etc.) defined in the `DataCleaner` class.

4. **Correcting or Flagging (if is_corrected(r) then... else...):**
   - `if is_corrected(r) then`: If the tuple `r` is successfully corrected by the rules, it is added to `CorrectionEdits` (denoted as `r+`).
   - `else`: If the tuple cannot be corrected, it is added to `FlaggingEdits` (denoted as `r−`), and the tuple is flagged in the database.

5. **Removing Processed Tuple (Remove `r` from `S`):**
   - After processing each tuple (either correcting or flagging), it is removed from the set `S`.

6. **Processing Most Frequent Problematic Tuple (if S ≠ ∅ then...):**
   - If there are still tuples left in `S` after the initial pass, the algorithm identifies the most common problematic tuple in `S` (using `MostFrequentTuple(S)`).
   - If this most frequent tuple can be corrected, it is added to `CorrectionEdits` and removed from all sets in `S`.
   - If it cannot be corrected, it is added to `FlaggingEdits` and removed from all sets in `S`.

7. **Return Results (return (CorrectionEdits, FlaggingEdits)):**
   - Finally, the algorithm returns two sets: `CorrectionEdits`, which contains all tuples that were corrected, and `FlaggingEdits`, which contains all tuples that were flagged as erroneous.

#### Variables and Their Roles

- `Q`: The input query used to identify potentially erroneous data.
- `D`: The database where the data resides.
- `t`: A specific tuple that is initially identified as potentially wrong.
- `CorrectionEdits`: A set that stores tuples that have been corrected.
- `FlaggingEdits`: A set that stores tuples that have been flagged as erroneous.
- `S`: A set of tuples that are suspected to be erroneous, based on `Q`, `D`, and `t`.
- `r`: Represents a current tuple being processed from set `S`.

#### Additional Functions

- `infer_issues(t, Q, D)`: A function that infers potential issues in the tuples based on the query `Q` and the database `D`.
- `is_corrected(r)`: A function that checks if a tuple `r` is corrected according to the rules.
- `MostFrequentTuple(S)`: A function that finds the most frequently occurring problematic tuple in the set `S`.
